# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction-ML

Task

Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task


Goal

Our goal is to determine whether a every applicant is  'good' or 'bad'. We will be achieving this by building a machine learning model to learn the features and tune it to predict the target (STATUS) variable.
•	Using supervised machine learning methods to predict the STATUS value of an asteroid as Y/N
•	To determine the most efficient algorithms with the highest accuracy score for the given Dataset
•	Visualizing the performance of the models using confusion matrix and ROC curves.
